These vehicles incorporate a variety of technologies such as sensors (laser, radar) and electronic maps to detect the surrounding environment. By combining this with machine learning algorithms and other electronics the car is able to start, stop and navigate obstacles on the road. We can think of them as automotive robots. To see how this works, I encourage you to watch the video below from the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsaES--OTzM&list=PLc2496NnT82vRe1dXzsfK1gsFiGEu_ty8" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsaES--OTzM&list=PLc2496NnT82vRe1dXzsfK1gsFiGEu_ty8">Google Self-Driving Car Project</a>” YouTube channel. It should become apparent from this video, that the smarts of this system really comes from the software that is running to interpret in real-time the sensor data that is being generated.</p><p><strong>Who is pursuing this research?</strong><br>Self-driving cars are being explored by Google and some vehicle manufacturers such as Nissan. There have also several organisations associated with artificial intelligence and robotics that have compete in the annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge">DARPA Grand Challenge</a>, so obviously military application is in sight.</p><p>From Google’s perspective, the self-driving car project was led back in 2011 and led by one very bright mind by the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun">Sebastian Thru</a>, at the time VP of Engineering at Google and a computer science research professor at Stanford University.</p><p><strong>Applications</strong><br>Clearly the application here is pervasive across transport industries, specifically road vehicles in the first instance. To some extent this is happening in the mining industry with remote controlled vehicles that will over time adopt more automated algorithm based robotics. I suspect that economics will drive the point end of adoption. In that I would guess that taxi organisations will replace their drivers with robotic cars and that this will lead to a broader societal adoption. Why? My estimate is that these taxi organisations will consolidate and seek to dominate the market so that their self-driving vehicles have a high capacity utilisation rate, meaning promotion of their product to the effect that consuming a self-driving car service will be cheaper and generally more beneficial than having ownership of a vehicle. It will be beneficial for all concerned.</p><p><strong>Societal Impacts</strong><br>This is definitely DISRUPTIVE !   So what are the flow on impacts, assuming self-driving cars become the norm and that the technology is proven/semi-mature.</p><ul><li><em>Safety –</em>significantly less accidents.</li><li><em>Insurance</em>– significantly less accidents, lower premiums.</li><li><em>Job displacement</em>– taxi drivers either become redundant and/or their role changes (to what I don’t know, perhaps that of a concierge).</li><li><em>Lifestyle</em>– no longer do we need to spend our time concentrating on the road. I would guess that human beings spend an average of 1.5 hours driving. This is about 10% of your life (awake). Now I don’t know about you, but if I have to commute to work, I would rather spend that time on leisure or work, preferably leisure. So this means 1.5 hours per day reading, watching movies, or progressing some work.</li><li><em>Ubiquitous transport</em>– at some point if all vehicles are simply a means for transport, then I can’t see the purpose of ownership. For example, I can foresee a situation whereby an organisation takes ownership of a large fleet of self-driving vehicles and through a phone App enables you to books or flag a self-driving car, giving you the option to share a car with somebody else going to a similar destination. I am thinking something like a train/tram but more convenient and everywhere.</li><li><em>Parking space savings</em>– savings on having to pay for parking as well as the freed up land that is consumed by parking lots / car parks.</li><li><em>Engineering efficiency</em>– these vehicles will optimise their interactions and in the process also optimise travel routes and speeds. Without the need for a driver and taking into consideration the other factors relating to speed of travel and safety, it would not be unrealistic to expect new car design to arise. This might mean smaller, lighter cars and more engineered efficiency.</li><li><em>Fuel efficiency and environment benefits</em>– combining ubiquitous transport with engineering efficiency will provide significant fuel efficiency and environmental benefits, and this is not yet taking into account technological benefits of electric cars and other alternative technologies that have not yet come to market.</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges</strong><br>There are still<em>technological challenges</em>at the moment with this system. It still relies to some extent on high resolution, pervasive and accurate mapping. The challenge within lies with the need to improve global mapping, which Google is pursuing, but equally the challenge will be to improve the machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. My expectation is that in time the artificial intelligence capabilities will improve through both software sophistication and through hardware. Hardware (computer processing, memory, storage) will continue to grow exponentially over time as it has in the past. I think as the AI capabilities improve, the reliance upon predefined maps and mapping resolution will become less.</p><p>Another big challenge is the<em>psychological concern of individuals</em>in regards to letting a vehicle take control of the driving process. To some extent this will be softened by the benefits realisation mentioned above in societal impacts, but also by increasing presence of “smart machines” in our life between now and then. We can expect to see the increasing presence of “smart machines” that are less challenging to get to market, examples being “smart” appliances, “smart” TVs, “smart” automotive features like self-parking, “smart” AI based voice interaction.</p><p>The psychological concern is no doubt going to be impacted by how “accidents” in the self-driving era are managed (from a PR perspective). Think Malaysian airlines.. not a lot of people wanting to travel via Malaysian airlines these days. Google has acknowledged to date that they have driven over 700,000 miles with self-driving cars and have experienced a few accidents, but that these accidents have always occurred when a human has taken control or when another party had caused the accident. The PR management will be critical to the success of the self-driving venture.</p><p><strong>Where to from here?</strong><br>Research organisations will continue to research and will compete to bring the product to market as quickly as they can in an economical fashion… some faster than others. I have seen in media that Google has preliminary expectations for commercialisation within 7 years. I think between now and then, other technologies will come to enhance the progress. In general we should not underestimate both the difficulty of the challenge but equally as linear thinking human beings, we should not underestimate the exponential rate of growth in technology.</p><p>Governments have begun legislating to support self-driving vehicles. Governments are beginning to realise the importance for countries to be creative / innovative in order to be competitive. Subsequently we have begun seeing legislation from the UK government and various US municipalities/counties/states to this effect (refer to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car#Commercialization" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car#Commercialization">Wikipedia</a> and this<a href="http://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/fayetteville/2014/07/28/fayette-official-we-will-try-out-driverless-car/13300935/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/fayetteville/2014/07/28/fayette-official-we-will-try-out-driverless-car/13300935/">article</a>)</p><p><strong>When?</strong><br>My guess is that self-driving cars will be proven enough to have adoption at scale by 2025, and to some extent this will be dependent on how well existing vehicles can be retrofitted with the necessary technology.</p><p>I would also guess that by 2035, laws will be passed to enforce adoption of self-driving cars in the interests of safety. This is a government legislative response to protect citizens from harming one another… e.g. no smoking in an enclosed space (you can kill yourself with smoking, but you shouldn’t kill others with it).</p><p>Looking for more?</p><ul><li>Here is a blog<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/07/the-self-driving-reset.html" data-cke-saved-href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/07/the-self-driving-reset.html">post</a>by Seth Godin on the same subject.
